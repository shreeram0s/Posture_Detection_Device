Copy code
This project is a posture detection system that uses sensors (e.g., MPU-6050) to monitor body alignment. It detects poor posture and provides feedback via a vibration motor or LED, helping users maintain proper posture and prevent back or neck strain.
3. Features
List the key features of your project.

 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/posture-detection.git
markdown
Copy code
2. Open the project in the Android Studio .
3. Connect the hardware components:
- MPU-6050 to Arduino (I2C pins: SDA and SCL)
- Vibration motor or LED to pin 9
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
5. Open the Serial Monitor for real-time readings.
6. Circuit Diagram
If available, include an image or description of the hardware setup.

 Circuit Diagram
Connect the following:
- MPU-6050:
  - VCC to 5V
  - GND to GND
  - SDA to A4 (on Arduino Uno)
  - SCL to A5 (on Arduino Uno)
- Vibration Motor or LED:
  - Positive terminal to pin 9
  - Negative terminal to GND
7. Configuration
Explain how users can customize the project (e.g., changing threshold values).
